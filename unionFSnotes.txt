Revision 3766:
Implemented UnionFS


The existing AuxFS used 10% of the Flash and only stored 'dhcp.leases'.  Now it is expanded to use all the avaliable space, approx 6 MiB. It works similar to the OpenWRT overlay, but probably implemented differently.





Location:
---------
/pivotinit/mnt/root-ro/   = SquashFS   (mtdblock0)
/pivotinit/mnt/overlay/   = JFFS2      (mtdblock1)
/pivotinit/mnt/root-rw/   = Combined, and used as the root dir

if you 'delete' a SquashFS file, you can undelete it from the overlay directory.  Deleted files start with '.wh.'





Recovery:
---------
The normal recovery mode (bootloader): Hold the WPS button while you power on.  Within a few seconds you will have access to the basic web interface to re-flash the stock firmware.

If you delete/change an important bootup file. You can erase the JFFS2 partition during bootup.

The addition recovery mode: Hold the WPS button starting between 5 to 25 seconds after you power on.  When the SkyHD led turns on, it will erase the R/W partition & reboot.





Implementation details are in '/etc/init.d/rcS'
